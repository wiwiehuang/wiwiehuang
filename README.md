## 💡 About Me

I’m a freelance Accounting and Data Entry Specialist with over 7 years of experience helping businesses keep their records precise and operations efficient. I’ve worked with e-commerce brands, fintech companies, and multinational teams on everything from daily transaction processing to ERP system configuration.

My experience spans ERP system (SAP HANA, Kingdee, YONYOU), accounting software (Accurate, MYOB, Tradepac), and marketplaces and fintech tools like Shopee Ads, Facebook Ads, and Paymongo. Whether collaborating with cross-functional teams or managing projects independently, I’m dedicated to delivering clear, dependable results.
